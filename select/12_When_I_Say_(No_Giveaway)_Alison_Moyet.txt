Should I be seen with you one more time?
My life is really on the line
His sister said she caught me out
If this gets back I'm dead without a doubt

Try to ignore me each time we meet
Don't ever stop me in the street
He thinks I'm at the launder mat
I cant stay here he wants his washing back

So when I say, (when I say)
That I don't know your face
Don't feign surprise, (don't feign surprise
Don't betray me with your eyes
But when I say, (when I say)
That you are out of place
Don't let them see, (don't let them see)
What you really are to me

Before this trouble blows sky high
I need to find myself an alibi

Why do you have to get so uptight?
There's no need to be so impolite
Just give me back my negatives
And I wont tell your wife about last night

So when I say, (when I say)
That I don't know your face
Don't feign surprise, (don't feign surprise)
Don't betray me with your eyes
But when I say, (when I say)
That you are out of place
Don't let them see,(don't let them see)
What you really are to me

But when I say, (when I say)
That I don't know your face
Don't feign surprise,(don't feign surprise)
Don't betray me with your eyes
But when I say, (when I say)
That you are out of place
Don't let them see, (don't let them see)
What you really are to me

But when I say,(when I say)
Don't feign surprise, don't betray me with your eyes
