Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, say
I keep tryna tell ya, you can't keep me on a leash
No matter how hard you train me
I'll do what I want in the end, and you can't disagree
But they make it so hard to be faithful
They make it so hard on me
The top of the day, baby, look what they wearin'
I'm just headed up the street, they ain't carin'
Yeah, and every time I try to mind my own business (yeah)
She gon' come around and make me so tempted (yeah, yeah)
She gon' ask me when I'm gon', gon' get it
Lord can you help me? Get me out of here
And I want to keep the peace, it's so hard for me
You keep tryna tell me
It's only as hard as you think
No matter what broad you bangin'
You know who you love in the end
And I can't disagree
But lately I'm tryin' to be faithful
As long as I'm off the drink
She look like she married, but why is she starin'?
She think I'm afraid to reach, don't dare me
Yeah, and every time I try to mind my own business (yeah)
She gon' come around and make me so tempted (yeah, yeah)
She gon' ask me when I'm gon', gon' get it
Lord can you help me? Get me out of here
Ooh nights like this I wish
I wish it wasn't hard for me
Ooh Lord give me strength
Uh, it's always the simple shit
I'm caught up again, yeah, yeah
Ooh nights like this, I wish
I wish it wasn't hard for me, yeah
Ooh Lord give me strength
Uh, it's always the simple shit, I'm caught up again
Mh, it's so hard for me, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, uh
It's always the simple shit yeah
It's so hard for me, it's so hard, yeah
Good to get away
All by myself each day
And talk to you
