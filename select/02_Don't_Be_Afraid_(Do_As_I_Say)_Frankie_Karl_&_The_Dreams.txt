Don't be afraid, do as I say, baby

Girl, please come closer (do it, do it)
Look me in the eye (do it, do it)

Squeeze with all your might (do it, do it)
Pucker your lips and kiss me, girl (do it, do it)
Taste love's pure delight

Don't be afraid, do as I say, baby
Don't be afraid, do as I say, baby
