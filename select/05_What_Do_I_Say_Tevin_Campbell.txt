Girl we've been the best of friends
And I never want that feelin' to end
But you've gotta now
What's been on my mind
'Cause I've been holding back,
Baby for the longest time

And every night, I lie alone in my bed
Pictures of me lovin' you
Runin' araound and around my head
Oh girl, I just gotta let you know
That I want you
I need you
And I never want to let u go

CHORUS
What do I say
What do I do
Tell me baby just to get close to you
Waht do I say
What do I do
Tell me baby just to be next to you
Oh What do I say

Maybe you'll turn and just walk away
That's a chance that I just got to take
Said I got to know do u want me to
'Cuase I will never be free
Not baby 'till I know the truth

We always talk about the good times that we had
But for just one night let's talk about what lies ahead
Oh girl, when look into your eyes
I wanna touch you
I wanna hug you
I wanna love you for the rest of my life

CHORUS

And every night, I lie alone in my bed
Pictures of me lovin' you
Runin' araound and around my head
Oh girl, I just gotta let you know
That I want you
I need you
And I never want to let u go

CHORUS
What do I say (x2)
